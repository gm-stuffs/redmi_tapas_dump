# starting_at_board_api(api_level, rules)
#
# This macro conditionally exposes SELinux rules within system/sepolicy/public,
# ensuring they are available to vendors only when the board API level is at or
# above the specified 'api_level'.
#
# * Platform sepolicy: Rules are always enabled, regardless of API level.
# * Vendor sepolicy: Rules are enabled only when the board API level meets or
#                    exceeds the value provided in 'api_level'.
#
# Apply this macro to public types and attributes (in system/sepolicy/public) to
# restrict vendor access based on board API level.
